# Nevermore

Nevermore Engine is a module-loader designed to simplify the loading of libraries and unify the networking of resources between the client and server. Nevermore comes equipped with a large codebase of useful libraries intended to streamline game development on [ROBLOX](http://roblox.com).

## Features

Nevermore has a long list features, some are in development, and others are fully implemented. These include:

- [x] **OOP** - Nevermore's core components are fully *Object Oriented Programming* ready.
- [x] **On-request Loading** - Nevermore will only load the features you use. No more, no less.
- [x] **Tested** - Nevermore is thoroughly tested before each release. It won't break your code.
- [ ] **Easy Setup** - Nevermore's [installer plugin](https://github.com/NevermoreEngine/Installation-Plugin) will get Nevermore and the modules you want set up for you.
- [x] **Plays well with others** - Nevermore won't interfere with other frameworks or your existing code.

## Getting Started
